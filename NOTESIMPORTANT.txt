//function that prompts the user for their password selection (ask length first)
//variable to store the length array 
//alert to ask for length of password assign to length variable
//if user input is not a number reject
//if user input 8>, rejects
//if user input more than 128 reject

//variable to store user choice about special charcaters = answer to their confirm we use confirms not alerts)
//add msg"Do you want special charcaters"

//variable to store user choice about uppercase charcaters = answer to their confirm we use confirms not alerts)

//add msg"Do you want special charcaters"

//variable to store user choice about numeric charcaters = answer to their confirm we use confirms not alerts)
//add msg"Do you want special charcaters"

//if all characters confirms are false, tell user they must pick one group and return (add return here to function)


**this is where i left off**
//function to randomly generate password (array)
    var options = mathfloor(mathrandom() * array.length)
    return options(WILL generate one at a time thats why we need a loop)

//function to generate password
    //var = password options function
    array = []
    //check if option has special charachters
    array = array.concat(specialCharacters)    
    ////check if option has uppercase charachters
    array = array.concat(specialCharacters)
    //check if option has number charachters
    //check if option has lowercase charachters(looking in the object itself to find the charcters)
    //(true or false because they are confirms as in ok or cancel)
//for loop to call randomly generate password, we want to pass our array

//function to random generate password(array)
//var options = mathfloor(Mathrandom()* array length)
//return options

//Write password to the #password input
