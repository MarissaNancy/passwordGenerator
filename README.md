# passwordGenerator

## Description
For this homework we have to modify javascript code so that we can generate random passwords. To generate the password we will provide users with options and generate it based off of their selections. They will have the option to choose password length and what special charachters they want or dont want to include. Password generator should work well and be responsive.

## User Story
An employee with access to data wants to be able to generate a password that meets certain criteria. This should help to create a strong password thus providing stronger security. 

## Directions
Modify javascript so that we can create a strong password for user. We must provide user with options and user must select at least one option so that we can generate the password for them.  

## Acceptance Criteria 
When user goes to page and is prompted with a series of promtps to choose password criteria. User should be able to select the criteria they want and don't want to include. The first option will be password length and user will be able to choose a length betweeen 8 and 128. The user will then be asked which character type they want to include. If they do not choose any user should be prompted that in order for us to generate a password, at least one charachter type has to be selected. After all prompts are answered then a password will be generated to match users selections. Password should be displayed in an alert or on page.
